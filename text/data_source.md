## RNA STRAND数据库

* [RNA STRAND](http://www.rnasoft.ca/strand/)

RNA STRAND contains known RNA secondary structures of any type and organism. The ultimate goal of this database is to incorporate a comprehensive collection of known RNA secondary structures, and to provide the scientific community with simple yet powerful ways of analysing, searching and updating the proposed database.

## PDB数据库

* [RCSB PDB](http://www.rcsb.org/)

This resource is powered by the Protein Data Bank archive-information about the 3D shapes of proteins, nucleic acids, and complex assemblies that helps students and researchers understand all aspects of biomedicine and agriculture, from protein synthesis to health and disease.The RCSB PDB builds upon the data by creating tools and resources for research and education in molecular biology, structural biology, computational biology, and beyond.
